    <h2 id="nothing-happens">Why does nothing happen when I commit?</h2>
    <p>
      You may have opened the wrong project. Make sure that the project that you
      opened was in the same folder as the one you chose when starting the
      project. In the future, this may be made less confusing.
      
      Also, make sure that the Sprite folders addon is disabled (for now).
    </p>
    <h2 id="valid-creds">Do I have to use a valid name or registered email to make commits?</h2>
    <p>No, just make sure that the email is formatted correctly.</p>
    <h2>How can I label script changes with something other than a number?</h2>
    <p>
      If you attach a text comment to the first block of a script, scratch.git
      will use the comment's label instead of a number.
    </p>
    <h2 id="addon-incompat">When I enable an addon, it breaks. Why?</h2>
    <p>
    As of now, the following addons are not fully compatible with scratch.git:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/ajskateboarder/scratch-git/issues/48">Sprite folders</a>
      </li>
      <li>Cat blocks</li>
      <li>
        Customizable block colors (diffs only use regular, high-contrast, and
        dark-mode colors)
      </li>
      <li>Square block inputs</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2 id="wrong-scripts">When I delete or detach a block from script, it selects the wrong scripts. Why?</h2>
    <p>
      If you save after forming two identical scripts, the wrong script may be selected due to how we process scripts.
      Additionally, scratch.git may also display extraneous diffs where more scripts are changed than in reality.
      Both of these oddities don't have a meaningful impact on development or an easy solution, so they will likely stick around.
