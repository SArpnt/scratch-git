        As scratch.git is meant to be part of an ecosystem primarily for young children, it is important to point out
        that <b>we respect your privacy</b> (as a tiny passion project, we seriously don't care about your
        data). Regardless, this document outlines places where your data may be collected or
        disclosed.</p>
    <p><code>scratch.git</code>: the main component of our project: <a
            href="https://github.com/ajskateboarder/scratch-git">https://github.com/ajskateboarder/scratch-git</a>.</p>
    <p><code>Git</code>: a version control system used by scratch.git to keep track of project versions: <a
            href="https://git-scm.com/">https://git-scm.com/</a></p>
    <p><code>repository</code>: a local or online storage containing all versions of a project</p>

    <h3>Third Parties</h3>
    <p>
        By using scratch.git, you agree to be bound by <a href="https://turbowarp.org/privacy.html">TurboWarp Desktop's
            privacy policy</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you clone, pull from, or push to a repository, you are subject to the privacy policy of the site hosting
        that repository. For example, when pushing to GitHub, you are subject to <a
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement">GitHub's
            privacy policy</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        As scratch.git makes use of icons provided by <a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare's CDN</a>, you
        are subject to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">Cloudflare's privacy policy</a> and anonymous
        usage data may be collected by the service, as stated by the "What about the privacy of my users?"
        section of the CDN homepage.
    </p>
    <h3>Authentication</h3>
    <p>When authenticating with scratch.git to push to a GitHub repository, we will store and reuse a temporary <a
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app">user
            access token</a> locally only for authentication purposes. When authenticating to push to other online
        repositories, Git will prompt you for your username and password. This
        information is used once, not stored anywhere, and is only for authentication purposes.</p>
    <h3>Preferences</h3>
    <p>All preferences for viewing diffs (e.g., using plain text, using highlights) for scratch.git are stored in the
        application and are not shared with third parties. Preferences
        persist after reloading TurboWarp Desktop, but can be cleared from the browser console.
    </p>
    <p>Preferences for committing to repositories (e.g., name, email address) are only shared with Git and used for no
        other purpose.</p>
